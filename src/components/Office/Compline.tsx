                        O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour, / and have such pleasure in vanity,
                        and seek after falsehood?<br />

                        the Lord, he will hear me.<br />
                        Stand in awe, and sin not; / commune with your own heart, and in your chamber, and be still.<br />
                        Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, / and put your trust in the Lord.<br />
                        There be many that say, / Who will shew us any good?<br />
